### Data Types
| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Integer | Whole numbers, both positive and negative. |
| Float/Real | Decimal numbers, used for more precise calculations. |
| Boolean | True or False values, used in logical operations. |
| String | A sequence of characters, used for text manipulation. |
| Character | A single text character, such as a letter or number. |

### Data Structures
| Structure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Associative Array | A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a value. |
| One-dimensional Array | A collection of elements of the same data type, accessed using an integer index. |
| Record | A collection of elements of varying data types, accessed using a field index. |

### Algorithms
| Algorithm | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Selection Sort | A sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element in the list and places it at the beginning, then repeats this process for the remaining elements. |
| Quick Sort | A sorting algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the list into two smaller lists, one with elements less than the pivot and one with elements greater than the pivot. This process is recursively applied to the smaller lists. |
| Binary Search | A search algorithm that repeatedly divides a sorted list in half until the target element is found or the search interval is empty. |
| Linear Search | A search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in the list until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached. |

### Validation Techniques
| Technique | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Existence Checking | Verifies that a value has been entered. |
| Range Checking | Verifies that a value is within a specified range. |
| Type Checking | Verifies that a value is of the correct data type. |

### Development Models
| Model | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Agile | An iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. |
| Spiral | A risk-driven approach that combines elements of both design and prototyping in stages. |
| Waterfall | A linear approach where each phase of development must be completed before moving on to the next phase. |

### Design Tools
| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data Dictionary | A document that describes the structure, format, and relationships of data elements used in a software application. |
| Mock-up | A visual representation of a user interface, showing the layout and appearance of the solution. |
| Object Description | A detailed description of the properties and methods of an object in a solution. |
| Pseudocode | A simple, high-level representation of a solution, using a mix of natural language and programming constructs. |

### Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Functional Requirements | The features and capabilities that the solution must have to meet its purpose. |
| Non-Functional Requirements | The characteristics or qualities that the solution must have, such as performance, usability, and reliability. |
| Constraints | The limitations, restrictions, or conditions that affect the development and implementation of the solution. |
| Scope | The boundaries or extent of the solution, including what is included and excluded from the solution. |

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)
| Diagram | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Use Case Diagram | A visual representation of the interactions between users and a system, showing the system's functionality and the users' roles. |
| Context Diagram | A high-level diagram that shows the interactions between a system and its environment, including external entities and data flows. |
| Data Flow Diagram | A diagram that shows the flow of data within a system, including processes, data stores, and external entities. |

### User Interface Design
| Factor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Affordance | The design aspects that suggest how a user should interact with a solution. |
| Interoperability | The ability of a solution to work with other systems or components. |
| Marketability | The potential of a solution to be successfully introduced and adopted in the market. |
| Security | The protection of a solution from unauthorized access, misuse, or damage. |
| Usability | The ease with which a user can learn, operate, and achieve their goals using a solution. |
