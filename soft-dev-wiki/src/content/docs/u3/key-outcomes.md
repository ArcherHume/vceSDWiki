description: "The key outcomes for Unit 3: Software Development."
---
Unit 3 has two primary outcomes:

1. Interpret teacher-provided solution requirements and designs, and apply a range of functions and techniques using a programming language to develop and test working software modules.
2. Analyze and document a need or opportunity, justify the use of an appropriate development model, formulate a project plan, generate alternative design ideas, and represent the preferred solution design for creating a software solution.

To assess the students' achievement of these outcomes, the following methods are used:

- School-assessed Coursework for Unit 3 contributes 10% to the study score.
- A School-assessed Task (SAT) that covers Unit 3, Outcome 2, and Unit 4, Outcome 1.
- An end-of-year examination for Units 3 and 4, which contributes 50% to the study score.
