### 2.1 School-assessed Task (SAT) Overview

The School-assessed Task (SAT) is an essential component of the VCE Software Development course, contributing to the student's final assessment. The SAT is divided into two parts, with the first part being completed in Unit 3, Area of Study 2, and the second part in Unit 4, Area of Study 1.

**Unit 3 SAT Components:**

- Analyzing a need or opportunity
- Formulating a project plan
- Generating alternative design ideas
- Representing the preferred solution design

**Unit 4 SAT Components:**

- Developing the preferred solution design
- Evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the software solution

### 2.2 Project Planning and Development Models

When planning a software development project, it is crucial to select an appropriate development model. There are several development models to choose from, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Some popular development models include:

1. **Agile:** Emphasizes flexibility and collaboration, with iterative development cycles and regular feedback from stakeholders.
2. **Spiral:** Combines elements of the waterfall and iterative models, with a focus on risk assessment and mitigation.
2. **Waterfall:** A linear and sequential approach, with each stage of development completed before moving on to the next.

| Development Model | Characteristics | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-------------------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Agile             | - Iterative development<br>- Regular stakeholder feedback<br>- Emphasis on collaboration | - Flexible<br>- Adaptable to changing requirements<br>- High stakeholder involvement | - Less predictable<br>- Requires commitment from stakeholders<br>- Difficult to estimate time and costs |
| Spiral            | - Combines waterfall and iterative models<br>- Focus on risk assessment and mitigation | - Strong emphasis on risk management<br>- Allows for changes in requirements<br>- Good for large and complex projects | - Requires significant resources<br>- Can be time-consuming<br>- Documentation can be complex |
| Waterfall         | - Linear and sequential approach<br>- Each stage completed before the next begins | - Easy to understand and manage<br>- Clear milestones and deliverables<br>- Good for small and well-defined projects | - Inflexible<br>- Difficult to accommodate changes<br>- Stakeholder feedback limited to specific stages |

### 2.3 Data Collection and Analysis Tools

When analyzing a need or opportunity, it is essential to collect and interpret data to determine the requirements and constraints of the software solution. There are several techniques for collecting data, such as:

- **Interviews:** Conducting one-on-one or group discussions with stakeholders to gather insights and opinions.
- **Observation:** Monitoring and recording user interactions with existing systems to identify areas for improvement.
- **Reports:** Reviewing existing documentation, such as user manuals or system specifications, to gain insights into the current system.
- **Surveys:** Distributing questionnaires to stakeholders to collect quantitative and qualitative data.

Once the data is collected, various analysis tools and techniques can be used to depict relationships between data, users, and digital systems. Some examples of these tools include:

- **Use Case Diagrams:** Created using Unified Modeling Language (UML) to show the interactions between users and the system.
- **Context Diagrams:** Depict the overall scope and boundaries of the system, including external entities and data flows.
- **Data Flow Diagrams:** Visualize the movement of data between processes, data stores, and external entities within the system.

### 2.4 Software Requirements Specification

A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a comprehensive document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and scope of a software solution. The SRS serves as a reference for both the development team and the stakeholders, ensuring a clear understanding of the system's objectives.

Key components of an SRS include:

- **Introduction:** Provides an overview of the software solution, its purpose, and objectives.
- **Functional Requirements:** Describes the expected features and functionalities of the system, including specific inputs, processes, and outputs.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Addresses aspects of the system that are not directly related to its core functionality, such as performance, security, and usability.
- **Constraints:** Lists the limitations or restrictions that may impact the development and implementation of the solution, such as economic, legal, social, technical, and usability factors.
- **Scope:** Defines the boundaries of the solution, including the target audience, the intended purpose, and any assumptions or dependencies.

By documenting the analysis in a Software Requirements Specification, the development team can ensure that all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the project's objectives, requirements, and constraints.

### 2.5 Generating and Evaluating Design Ideas

To generate and evaluate design ideas effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Brainstorming**: Generate multiple design ideas to address the problem or opportunity identified in the analysis.
   - Use techniques such as mind mapping, sketching, and group discussions.
2. **Documentation**: Document each design idea, including key functions and appearance.
3. **Evaluation Criteria**: Develop a set of criteria to evaluate the design ideas. These criteria should consider factors such as:
   - Efficiency and effectiveness of the solution
   - Usability and user experience
   - Security and data protection
   - Interoperability and marketability
   - Technical feasibility
4. **Evaluate Design Ideas**: Apply the evaluation criteria to each design idea and compare their strengths and weaknesses. This will help in selecting the preferred design idea.

### 2.6 Detailed Solution Design

Once the preferred design idea is selected, create a detailed solution design that includes:

- **Data structures**: Define the data types and structures required for the solution, such as arrays, records, and dictionaries.
- **Algorithm design**: Develop algorithms for key functions, such as sorting and searching.
- **User interface**: Design an efficient and effective user interface that considers usability, accessibility, and aesthetics.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation using design tools and techniques, such as data dictionaries, mock-ups, object descriptions, and pseudocode.

### 2.7 Design Thinking Skills

Design thinking skills play a crucial role in creating successful software solutions. These skills include:

- **Empathy**: Understand the needs and requirements of users to design solutions that address their problems.
- **Collaboration**: Work effectively with others to generate and evaluate design ideas, and to develop the preferred solution design.
- **Creativity**: Apply innovative thinking to create unique and effective design ideas.
- **Critical thinking**: Analyze and evaluate design ideas based on the established evaluation criteria.
- **Communication**: Clearly communicate design ideas and decisions using appropriate tools and techniques.
