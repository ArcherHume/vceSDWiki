In Unit 3, students focus on applying the problem-solving methodology to develop working software modules using a programming language. They develop an understanding of the analysis, design, and development stages of the problem-solving methodology.

There are two main areas of study in this unit:

- Area of Study 1: Software Development - Programming
- Area of Study 2: Software Development - Analysis and Design

In Area of Study 1, students work with teacher-provided solution requirements and designs, developing a set of working modules using a programming language. They also examine software requirements specifications and various software design tools.

Area of Study 2 is the first part of the School-assessed Task (SAT), where students analyze a need or opportunity, select an appropriate development model, create a project plan, develop a software requirements specification, and design a software solution. The SAT continues in Unit 4, Area of Study 1.
