2. **Determining solution requirements**: Students must define the functional and non-functional requirements of the solution. This includes understanding the desired features, performance expectations, and any constraints that may impact the solution's development.

3. **Designing the solution**: In this stage, students generate and document alternative design ideas using various design tools such as data dictionaries, mock-ups, object descriptions, and pseudocode. They also develop evaluation criteria to select the preferred design and then create a detailed representation of the chosen solution.

4. **Developing the solution**: Students use a programming language to implement the solution according to the design specifications. This involves using appropriate data structures, algorithms, and processing features to create the working software modules.

5. **Testing and validating the solution**: Students apply validation techniques and test their solution to ensure it meets the design specifications and functions as intended. This includes using trace tables, constructing test data, and debugging the software modules.

6. **Documenting the solution**: Throughout the development process, students must create internal documentation to explain the function of the modules and the use of processing features. This ensures that the software is maintainable and can be easily understood by others.

By following the problem-solving methodology, students can systematically approach software development, ensuring they create effective and efficient solutions that meet the given requirements and constraints.

### 1.3 Developing Working Modules

To create effective software solutions, students must develop working software modules that meet the given solution requirements and designs. The process of developing working modules involves several key aspects, which are explained below:

1. **Interpreting Solution Requirements and Designs**: Students must first understand the provided solution requirements and designs. They can use various design tools, such as data dictionaries, mock-ups, object descriptions, and pseudocode, to accurately interpret the desired solution.

2. **Selecting Data Types and Data Structures**: Based on the solution requirements, students must choose appropriate data types and data structures to store and process information. Some examples include:
   - _Data types_: Integer, float, string, boolean, etc.
   - _Data structures_: Associative arrays (dictionaries or hash tables), one-dimensional arrays, and records.

3. **Applying Processing Features**: Students must apply relevant processing features of the chosen programming language to develop the working modules. These features can include:
   - _Control structures_: Loops, conditional statements, etc.
   - _Functions and methods_: Reusable code blocks that perform specific tasks.
   - _Classes_: Object-oriented programming constructs that encapsulate data and behavior.

4. **Implementing Algorithms**: Students need to implement various algorithms to process data and solve problems. Examples include:
   - _Sorting algorithms_: Selection sort, quick sort, etc.
   - _Searching algorithms_: Binary and linear searching.

5. **Validating and Testing**: Students must apply validation techniques, such as existence checking, range checking, and type checking, to ensure that the working modules function correctly. Additionally, they must use testing techniques like trace tables and test data construction to verify that the modules meet the design specifications.

6. **Documenting the Modules**: Throughout the development process, students should create internal documentation to explain the function of the modules and the use of processing features. This includes writing meaningful comments and using proper syntax, making the software maintainable and easily understood by others.

By following these steps, students can develop working software modules that meet the given requirements and designs, providing a foundation for creating a complete software solution in subsequent units.

### 1.4 Validation and Testing Techniques

Ensuring the quality and correctness of software modules is a critical part of the development process. Validation and testing techniques help identify and fix errors, ensuring that the modules function as intended. Some common validation and testing techniques include:

1. **Validation Techniques**: These techniques ensure that the input data and program logic are correct, and they help prevent errors from occurring during execution. Some examples include:
   - _Existence checking_: Verifying that a required input value or data element is present.
   - _Range checking_: Ensuring that an input value falls within a specified range of acceptable values.
   - _Type checking_: Confirming that an input value is of the expected data type.

2. **Testing Techniques**: These techniques are used to verify that the software modules meet their design specifications and function correctly. Some common testing techniques include:
   - _Trace tables_: A systematic way to track the values of variables and the flow of execution in a program. Trace tables help to identify errors in program logic and can be used for debugging.
   - _Test data construction_: Creating a set of test cases with a range of input values, including boundary cases, to ensure that the program functions correctly under various conditions.
   - _Unit testing_: Testing individual components or modules of the software to ensure that they function correctly in isolation.
   - _Integration testing_: Testing the interaction between multiple modules or components to ensure that they work correctly when combined.
   - _System testing_: Testing the entire software system, including its functionality, performance, and user interface, to ensure that it meets the overall requirements and design specifications.

By applying these validation and testing techniques throughout the development process, students can ensure that their software modules are of high quality and function as intended, providing a solid foundation for the development of a complete software solution.

### 1.5 Internal Documentation

Internal documentation is an essential aspect of software development, as it helps maintain the understandability and maintainability of the code. It includes comments, descriptive variable and function names, and proper syntax usage to clearly explain the purpose and functionality of the code. Below are some key elements of effective internal documentation:

1. **Meaningful Comments**: Comments should be used throughout the code to provide context and explain the purpose of specific sections, functions, or statements. They should be concise, clear, and informative, helping others understand the code's logic and intent.

2. **Descriptive Variable and Function Names**: Variable and function names should be chosen to clearly reflect their purpose or the data they represent. Using descriptive names can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

3. **Proper Syntax**: Adhering to the proper syntax of the chosen programming language is crucial for code readability. This includes using consistent indentation, spacing, and formatting throughout the code, making it visually organized and easier to understand.

4. **Modular Design**: Breaking the code into smaller, reusable modules or functions can improve its readability and maintainability. Each module should have a single, well-defined purpose, making it easier to understand and modify when needed.

5. **Version Control**: Using a version control system (e.g., Git) can help keep track of changes to the code over time and facilitate collaboration among team members. It also provides a history of modifications, making it easier to identify and fix issues when they arise.

By incorporating these internal documentation practices, students can create software that is easier to understand, maintain, and modify, improving the overall quality of their work and ensuring the long-term success of their software solutions.
